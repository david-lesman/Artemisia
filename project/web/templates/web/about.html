    <h1 class="title">Why we're doing this</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">While searching for project ideas, we decided to reflect on our day-to-day problems. One of our team members, Youri, brought up that when he was diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes mellitus at the age of 8, it was difficult for him and the kids around him to understand what it meant.</h2>
    <h2 class="subtitle">This problem inspired us to come up with our project <strong>Artemisia</strong>.</h2>
